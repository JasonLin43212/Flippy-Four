### Planned Features

* Having instructions on playing in gui

#### Remove/Unadded Features

* A way to save and load games
> We believe that this feature is unnecessary since most games do not last that long

* Bombs
> Deviates too much from original game

### Milestone

* Game is playable on Gui (1/12/18)

* Game has win messages (1/14/18)

* More COLORS (1/16/18)

* Colorful start screen (1/20/18)

* A Computer to play against (but not a very skillful computer) (1/20/18)

### Bugs

Fixed

* GUI rotation being weird

* Rotating makes the game a draw

Not fixed

* When in 'Set Interval' mode, after fulfilling the amount of pieces to start the rotation, the number of pieces to insert jumps to 6. This doesn't affect the gameplay, however, because it goes back to 5 after rotation is done.
